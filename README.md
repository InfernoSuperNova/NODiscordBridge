# NODiscordBridge

Discord integration for Nuclear Option. Currently only features a chat bridge via a bot.

Extract the contents of the tar ball into your BepInEX > plugins directory. Ensure that the deltawing.nodiscordchatbridge folder remains intact.
After running once, a discord_config.json file will appear in the game root. From here, you can input your bot token and the channel you wish to set up the bridge in. Currently, only the chat channel works.
